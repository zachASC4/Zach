More information on Symere Woods:            
Symere Woods, a black male more popularly known by his stage name Lil Uzi Vert,

is a singer and songwriter native to Philadelphia. The speaker in both of Lil Uzi Vert’s

“Do What I Want” (2016) and “Money Longer” (2016) seeks to depict to the extent in

which he is rich. By doing so he unknowingly and simultaneously reveals the effects

"winning" and "losing" has on one's psyche and actions, and how one is so overtaken by

the desire to win, that they seem to forget, and by extension reverse, principles that they

once believed in. These effects however, he is unaware of until “Ronda” (2016), where

the speaker takes a different approach as he evolves — thus his definition of winning

does too — and he attempts to right the wrongs that have been created as an effect of his

winning, namely his relationship with women.

The speaker describes his life as a linear progression trending upwards from losing

to winning. This is indicated by the speaker in “Do What I Want” when he says, “boy I

started on the bottom, made my way to the top” (l. 24). He continues on the next line with

“[re]member I had a little, (I did) turned that shit to a lot” (l.25), and he is bragging about

(his rags to riches story) the times that he had “little” financially, and how he eventually

began to win. Winning and losing, as defined by the speaker, are solely based on money.

Put simply, one is winning when they have a lot of money, and one is losing when they

do not. At first this transition from losing to winning would appear to be a positive

development in his life, but upon further review this began to have a negative effect,

because his morals declined as his winning increased.

The title and the second through seventh lines of “Do What I Want” include the

phrase “do what I want” (ll. 2-7), which illustrates to the reader that the fact that the

speaker can do what he wants is a focus of his. The “now” (l. 2) that precedes the “do

what I want” in the chorus (the section of the song that is repeated for emphasis) suggests

that the speaker was not always able to do what he wants, that there was some sort of

restriction on the speaker. This restriction can be deduced in simplest form as money, and

he puts this into words in “Ronda”,

I was lost, and then, yeah, I was found,

And on money yeah, um, I was down

We was already down

Nowhere else for us to go.

(ll. 13-16)

The speaker felt “lost”, and this is because he was “down” on money. However, he still

feels this lack of direction in but in a new way. This new lack of direction is satisfaction

because the speaker “now” has money and that is everything to him. He thinks that there

is “nowhere else” for him to go as he has already peaked and reached the top. The

speaker associates this climactic point in his life only to his increased amount of money.

“Now” that he does not have this restriction of money he feels carefree and content. This

reveals how much freedom and power the speaker believes money grants him. This

newly acquired sense of freedom and power he is not using on essential actions however,

but rather on actions he “want[s]”. The speaker’s focus on things he wants, not things he

needs, is a flawed set of principles in and of itself. This insatiable desire to not only do

what he wants, but to continue to win and gain money (because it gives him a sense of

security and a false sense invincibility) is what blinds the speaker of his formerly

possessed principles.

In “Money Longer”, the speaker describes the after effects now that his

money is “longer”. Lil Uzi Vert starts the song off with “it do not matter” (l. 1), which is

the same carefree tone and attitude the speaker displayed in “Do What I Want”. Lil Uzi

Vert specifically chooses “it” because it is a vague descriptor. The vagueness means that

it can encompass more aspects of the speaker’s life. The fact that this lax attitude refers to

multiple facets of the speaker’s life exhibits that the speaker’s principles have drastically

changed now that he has more money. The chorus of the song delineates the speaker’s life

now that his money is longer, and what he is now warranted to do because of it such as

indulging in narcotics, disrespecting women, and buying expensive items. The derogatory

words “bitch” and “hoe” appear a total of 5 times in this song, and those words

immediately display one’s lack of respect towards women. While referencing one of

Chris Brown’s works, “Loyal”, whose main message is how “hoes” are not loyal, the

speaker also criticizes women for their lack of loyalty by stating, “none of these hoes got

no morals” (l. 17). This is extremely hypocritical because by referring to women as

“hoes” he is revealing his own lack of morals. The speaker also exposes his lack of

respect for women by dedicating nearly an entire verse to degrading “his girl” (l. 37).

Through the examination of the use of possessives preceding “girl” (1. 21) and a Jay-Z

and Béyonce comparison in “Ronda”, as well as a Pharrell and Vashtie comparison in

“Money Longer”, it can be deduced that the “her” or “girl” referenced is the speaker’s

girlfriend. This relationship implies a certain level of commitment, but the speaker

appears to be oblivious to this implication post winning.

Besides the mention of tangible things money gives him, the speaker in “Money

Longer” denotes two specific non-tangible effects of his increased money, “Never

thought it would be days I could kick my feet up/ Never thought that she would need me

that much if I leave her” (ll. 20-21). The two effects of more money made apparent by the

speaker are: his decreased work ethic and his lost respect for women. By being

someone’s boyfriend you are simultaneously declaring your commitment to them. To all

of a sudden leave them is disrespectful in and of itself, but it is especially disrespectful if

it had been agreed previously upon that one relies on the other financially. If the speaker

did not have as much money as he does now he would be unable to justify his

engagement over-confident actions such as this. The speaker’s seems to have a fixation

on his relationship with women and his girlfriend, because he again makes known his

turbulent relationship with his girlfriend later in the song with, “When I’m with my girl

we’re Pharrell and Vashtie” (l. 37) Pharrell and Vashtie were once a couple, and upon

reflection of the relationship Pharrell explicitly stated he was egotistical at the time and

left Vashtie because he believed his money warranted him to do so. This reference also

serves a dual purpose: to show that the speaker, who is in a very similar situation as

Pharrell financially and egotistically, is predicting a similar outcome for he and his

girlfriend’s relationship. Additionally, it confirms the speaker as a reliable narrator as he

is not the only one to have gone down this path.

Respect towards women is also a principle all humans should embody, but is a

principle that is often lost in black communities especially as well as the American rap

industry, which not coincidentally is predominately black. Taking all of this into account,

one might find it surprising that Lil Uzi Vert includes a speaker that likens himself to a

woman. In “Ronda” or “Winners”, Lil Uzi Vert tells the tale of UFC fighter Ronda

Rousey who was undefeated before she unexpectedly lost to underdog Holly Holm. The

speaker likens himself to Ronda because the invincibility she felt before losing to Holly

Holm is paralleled to the invincibility he feels because of his money. Also because they

both experienced rude awakenings to their false sense of invincibility. For Ronda it was

losing to Holly, for the speaker it was the breakup with his girlfriend. The sections that

reference Ronda are exclusively in the chorus which indicates to the reader that Ronda is

a point of emphasis for him.

Ronda is a focus point of the speaker, so he characterizes her with more considerate

language. Unlike in several of his other works, such as “Money Longer” and “Do What I

Want”, no derogatory language is used to regarding Ronda or any woman in the entirety

of the song. Instead of disrespectful words such as “bitch” (l. 22) and “hoe” (l. 16) that he

used in “Do What I Want” and “Money Longer” respectively, the speaker in “Ronda”

fancies himself to more respectful words such as “baby” and “girl” to describe women.

This, by comparison, instantly illustrates a positive connotation of Ronda and this is the

speaker demonstrating his respect for Ronda and women as a whole. It also exhibits why

she, a woman who has created her own success just like the speaker, is the ideal woman,

not necessarily to have a relationship with, but to strive to be. He has not completely

changed his immoral ways though, because since he and Ronda are so closely linked in

their situations he is also transitively saying people should aspire to be (with) him. This is

hypocritical as he simultaneously questions people’s trustworthiness when they try to join

him, “This is a gang is you in or you out?” (l. 10) This lack of trust and increased

paranoia is not something he experienced pre-winning. Since he is skeptical of the people

around him, the speaker puts an emphasis on himself and his possessions. He continues

with a mention of his “diamond” grills, and how they are “all up in [his] mouth” (l. 11).

Grills do not have to cover all of one’s teeth, especially because (for the most part) only

grills in the the front of one’s teeth can be seen, but the speaker goes all out with the

diamond grills, which he is again only enabled to do because of money. The

excessiveness of his grills relates to his excessive characteristics in “Do What I Want”,

where he constantly describes himself and things relating to him with the suffix “er”.

The past is unable to be changed, but what one does with information gained

from past experiences is what the speaker finds intriguing. Not the development itself,

but rather the end product. “Get knocked down, act like you never lost/ Come back and

win like you Ronda Rousey” (ll. 1-2). Ronda lost to Holly, and there is not anything she

can do to change that loss, but the speaker believes that Ronda must shake off that loss as

if she had “never lost” and come back and win. The alternate title to “Ronda” is

“Winners” and this is because even though Ronda Rousey lost one fight to Holly Holm

she is still ultimately a winner because of her previous wins. Even though the speaker has

lost many of his morals and lost his girlfriend, he ultimately considers himself a winner

because of his affluence. At the same time however, the speaker appears to have began

changing his ways because he is also acknowledging his own losses, and understands that

he must come back and continue to win. The lack of derogatory words regarding women,

highlights his development in terms of ethics. The speaker fails to delineate the reasoning

for why certain events occurred, he leaves that for the reader to interpret, but he chooses

to outcome of these events is what is most important, the end result. Additionally, “Do

What I Want “was placed first in the track list for The Perfect Luv Tape, while “Ronda”

was placed next to last because it better juxtaposes and highlights the speaker’s moral

status.

The speaker’s changed tone is specifically spotlighted in the first verse of Ronda.

He has a reflective tone, because he is looking back upon his relationship with women,

now that he has broken up with his girlfriend.

Same girl that was on my poster

Damn, now I know

Treat my girl like I am Jay-Z

Treat my girl like she Beyoncé Knowles

(ll. 19-22)

The speaker “now” realizes that he is now with the “same girl” that he dreamed of being

with, the girl that “was on [his] “poster”, and that he must treat her differently. The “now”

that precedes “I know” suggests that there was some sort of event that caused him to

come to this realization. The realization is that he needs to treat his girl like she’s

Beyoncé and he’s Jay-Z. Many of Beyoncé’s critics believe that Jay-Z is subjectively less

attractive than Beyoncé and they often wonder why she has chosen to be with him, and

suggest she leave him, as with her attractiveness she could be with almost any person in

the world she wants to. In simpler terms, with this reference, the speaker is saying that he

must treat his girl like he needs her, as if she could leave him at any moment, and this

means with respect. This is a radical shift from “Money Longer” where the speaker

makes a Pharrell and Vashtie comparison and suggests that he could leave her at any

moment. Additionally, this new treatment he suggests he should embody is not only

something he thinks he should do, he “know[s]” it is. He later affirms his vow to treat his

girl with respect when he says, “Know I’ll go down for my baby/ Know I’m gon’ ride for

my baby/ Know that I got suicide for my baby”. The speaker would now do anything for


his girl, even commit suicide. This reveals to the extent in which he is contented, because

he is willing to take measures as extreme as suicide in order to make his “baby” satisfied,

something he would not have done before. He continues to demonstrate his newfound

state of satisfaction in the next line, “All in the way, I don’t care what they say”. The

“they” is referring to his haters as he continues with, “Yeah, boy, you fake/ Yeah, really

hate”. The speaker does not “care” what the haters have to “say” because he is content

with himself now, and for once this means more than financially. He is content with

himself financially as well as morally, because he knows he is parting ways with his

previous sense of morals. Additionally he is satisfied because he knows he is not done,

and that he will “come back and win”, but this now does not only refer to his money it

also refers to his integrity.

Lil Uzi Vert seems to be complicating the standard narrative that money turns

people evil, because by the end of this progression the speaker experiences a growth that

results in him being a better person overall. By the nature of hip-hop and music in

general, the speaker is often the artist, so it is safe to assume that Lil Uzi Vert’s songs are

biographical to some degree. Taking this into account, these songs can be taken as a

description of Lil Uzi Vert’s life. That being said, the speaker would have been unaware

at the time that the ends would justify the means, but upon contemplation afterwards, the

artist is able to see the nuances of the situation, because perspective is everything.
